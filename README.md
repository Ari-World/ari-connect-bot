## Installation
### Prerequisite
- Python 3.12.*
- pip 24.0

Before running all make sure that you have installed all modules that we'll be using, to do that run this command.
``` cmd
pip install -r requirements. txt
```

After that make sure that you have a `.env `file at the same level of the `main.py`.
How do I know the values for the *.env* file?
- Checkout `plugins > config.py` and check the returned values, you'll be able to see what are needed.
- To know the keys, you'll find in the config `os.getenv(<this is the key>)`
if you have now defined the config, put those keys with corresponding values, e.g.
```.env
DISCORD_API_TOKEN = <put your env file herer>

DISCORD_COMMAND_PREFIX = <desired prefix>

MONGO_DB_URL = <mongodb datbase url>

```
