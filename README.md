## Installation
### Prerequisite
- Python 3.12.*
- pip 24.0

Before running all make sure that you have installed all modules that we'll be using, to do that run this command.
``` cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that make sure that you have a `.env `file at the same level of the `main.py`.
How do I know the values for the *.env* file?
- Checkout `plugins > config.py` and check the returned values, you'll be able to see what are needed.
- To know the keys, you'll find in the config `os.getenv(<this is the key>)`
if you have now defined the config, put those keys with corresponding values, e.g.
```.env
DISCORD_API_TOKEN = 
DISCORD_COMMAND_PREFIX = 
MONGO_DB_URL =

# Logging ID
# Make sure that all channel ID is under the guild
LOG_GUILD_ID =

# Channel IDS for logging
LOG_CHAT_ID = 
LOG_SYSTEM_ID = 
LOG_MOD_ID = 
LOG_PLAYER_REPORT_ID = 

CACHE_THRESHOLD = 

GENERAL_LOBBY_NAME = 
```
